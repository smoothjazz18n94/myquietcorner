             <h2>About My Rhythm</h2>
            <p>I’m like a turtle; my shell is where I’m safe, and nobody gets under there with me. I’m more of an observer. I like being around people, just not always in the middle of everything. I’m comfortable in my own space, but once I trust someone, I’m steady and real.</p>
            <p>I don’t feel comfortable in crowds or group activities; it’s just my personality and how I relate to the world—just one-on-one connections or small gatherings. Crowd settings feel unfamiliar and draining.</p>
            <p>I’ve learned that peace and stability come from within, not depending on others. I grew up doing things solo and I’ve developed a protective instinct, keeping emotional distance that feels safer than risking disappointment. I value my independence and emotional balance.</p>
            <p>I value gestures, respect, and meaningful rituals. This is my natural rhythm with people. I’m a living harmony of depth, grace, and quiet appreciation—a minimalist spirit who sees the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>
